    "## 4. Building the Spline Interpolator\n",
    "\n",
    "After bootstrapping, we have discount factors at **discrete maturity points**. But we need rates at **arbitrary maturities** (e.g., 1.3 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cubic Splines?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear interpolation**: Gives kinks at data points (not smooth)\n",
    "- **Cubic spline**: Smooth curves through all points (used by most market practitioners)\n",
    "- **Log interpolation**: Interpolating log(DF) instead of DF directly ensures DFs stay between 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The module calls `_build_interpolation()` which:\n",
    "1. Takes the bootstrapped maturities and log(discount factors)\n",
    "2. Fits a cubic spline through them\n",
    "3. Stores the spline object for later interpolation\n",

    "## BONUS: Different Treasuries, Same Maturity → Different DFs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Real-World Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you might have **multiple instruments with the same maturity** but **different prices**:\n",
    "- A 2-year T-Note with 2.5% coupon: price $100.20\n",
    "- A 2-year T-Note with 3.0% coupon: price $101.10\n",
    "- A 2-year STRIP (zero-coupon): price $96.40\n",
    "\n",
    "**These are all 2-year maturity, but they give DIFFERENT discount factors!** How do we handle this?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Root Cause: Coupon Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "The discount factor extracted depends on **what cash flows you observe**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bond Type | Cash Flows | Implied DF | Issue |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------|\n",
    "| 2Y, 2.5% coupon | $1.25 @ 1Y, $101.25 @ 2Y | 0.9670 | Affected by coupon |\n",
    "| 2Y, 3.0% coupon | $1.50 @ 1Y, $101.50 @ 2Y | 0.9668 | Different coupon → different DF! |\n",
    "| 2Y STRIP | $100 @ 2Y only | 0.9640 | Cleanest signal |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Different coupons mean we solve for DF differently!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Use the \"Most Liquid\" Instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, practitioners handle this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prioritize instrument types in order of preference:**\n",
    "   - **Tier 1**: Strips (zero-coupon) - Direct DF measurement, no coupon effects\n",
    "   - **Tier 2**: Recently issued on-the-run notes/bonds - Highly liquid, tight bid-ask\n",
    "   - **Tier 3**: Older off-the-run bonds - Less liquid, wider spreads\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **One DF per maturity**: If multiple instruments give different DFs, use the most liquid one\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpolate for intermediate maturities**: Don't use every instrument, only key \"key rates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Module's Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at `yield_curve.py`, the current implementation:\n",
    "- ✓ Takes instruments in order of maturity\n",
    "- ✓ Solves for one DF per unique maturity\n",
    "- ✓ **Problem**: If you give it two 2-year bonds with different coupons, it uses the SECOND one\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simplification! Real-world curves would:\n",
    "1. Check for duplicates/similar maturities\n",
    "2. Choose the most liquid instrument\n",
    "3. Flag the others for review\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means for Your Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When you build a curve, you should **manually select** the best instrument for each key maturity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# BAD: Two instruments at 2Y with different coupons\n",
    "instruments = [\n",

    "## 7. Key Takeaways & Reference Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discount Factors Are Everything**\n",
    "   - They encode the market's valuation of money over time\n",
    "   - From DFs, we can calculate any rate (spot, forward, yield-to-maturity)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bootstrap Is Sequential**\n",
    "   - Each instrument allows us to solve for ONE new DF\n",
    "   - Must be sorted by maturity (short to long)\n",
    "   - Each step depends on previous results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpolation Fills the Gaps**\n",
    "   - Cubic splines create smooth curves from discrete points\n",
    "   - Uses log(DF) for mathematical stability\n",
    "   - Allows rate extraction at any maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validation Confirms Correctness**\n",
    "   - Price original instruments with the bootstrapped curve\n",
    "   - If prices match (within tolerance), bootstrap is correct\n",
    "   - Error typically < 1 basis point\n",
    "\n",

    "## BONUS 2: Extracting Discount Factors from Vanilla Interest Rate Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Vanilla IRS?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vanilla interest rate swap** is an exchange of cash flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Party A (you): Pay fixed rate 3.75% per year\n",
    "Party B: Pay you floating LIBOR per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Both on $100 notional, for 5 years\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key difference from bonds:**\n",
    "- Bond: You observe the **market price**\n",
    "- IRS: You observe the **fixed rate** (par = at swap initiation, price is always 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Extract DFs from IRS?\n",
    "\n",
    "IRS are **highly liquid** and available at **every maturity** (0.5Y, 1Y, 1.5Y, 2Y, ... 30Y). Bonds have gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So practitioners use IRS to build curves, especially the long end (2Y+).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bootstrap Equation for IRS\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 5-year swap:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Swap PV} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Fixed Leg Payment}_i \\times DF(t_i) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Floating Leg Expected Payments}_i \\times DF(t_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the swap's market fixed rate, **swap PV = 0** (it's fair):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Fixed} \\times DF(t_i) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Floating} \\times DF(t_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (\\text{Fixed} - \\text{Floating}) \\times DF(t_i) = (\\text{Fixed} - \\text{Floating}) \\times DF(T)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** Just like bonds, we can solve for the **unknown DF at maturity** if we know all previous DFs!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
